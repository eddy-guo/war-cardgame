# War

Crush your opponent in a personal recreation of the classic childhood card game, War. This was built using JavaScript classes and introduces basic object oriented programming.

## Getting Started

On pageload, the game starts with 26 cards per player, both decks face down. Once you click on your blue deck, the game starts! Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of their deck. If both cards are the same, both players take their respective card and puts them back on the bottom of their own deck. 

After one round, the deck counter is automatically updated - if the blue deck won the first round of the game, the card count is updated from 26-26 to 27-25.
